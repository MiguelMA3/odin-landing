# 🌌 SW Landing Page | The Odin Project

This project is a simple **Landing Page**, developed as part of the **Foundations** curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page).

The main goal was to demonstrate the application of fundamental HTML and CSS concepts, with a special focus on **Flexbox** for the layout and alignment of elements. The theme chosen for the page is the Star Wars universe.

## ✨ Features and Theme

The page is composed of four main sections, in addition to the header (`header`) and footer (`footer`), using the Star Wars universe as content:

1.  **Hero Section:** Presents a welcome message ("Hello there!") and a classic quote from the saga.
    * **Featured Quote:** "Only a Sith deals in absolutes. May the force be with you."
2.  **My Favorite Characters:** An information section with four cards, using Flexbox for the horizontal alignment of images and descriptions.
    * **Characters Included:** Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu, and General Grievous.
3.  **Yoda's Wisdom:** A quote section that uses a light background and italic text to emphasize the wisdom.
    * **Quote:** "Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering."
4.  **Contact/Call to Action:** A call-to-action block with a button, styled to stand out with the primary colors.
